## About
Shopping buddy is a web app that is meant to function as an online shopping list. It's a full-stack app with a functional back-end that was created with a focus on accessability. 

# Getting Started
Shopping Buddy can be demo'ed over on [heroku](https://shopping-buddy2.herokuapp.com/).

Getting started is simple. A sample grocery list has been pre loaded into the app's database, but it can freely be updated and appended to. 

Clicking on the "Details" button shows the current information stored about the item. The name, type, etc. are then displayed on a side panel. At this point users can decide to update their shopping list by clicking on the edit button.

New items can also be appended to the database simply by filling out the form below the details panel.
