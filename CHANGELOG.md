# Changelog 

## Development

- 0.1.0 Functional Prototype
>Working 'wireframe' prototype without functioning database. Moved groceries.json into `./routes/index.js` for testing purposes. No styling.

- 0.2.0 Functional Back-End
>Completed database CRUD methods and Groceries Schema. Adds the ability to render the current grocery list to handlebars index. This will be used to enable looping the active list.

- 0.2.1 Modified Schema and db reset functionality
>Modified Schema to make the combined index of `"name", "type", "brand"` fields unique. Added seeds.json and created controller methods allowing for easier reset of development db (testing purposes).
